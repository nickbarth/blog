# Work Faster with Vimscript

Modern web frameworks all have files closesly related to eachother in one way or another. Whether you're working in MVC or MVVM, Python or PHP, navigating back and forth between related files is often tedius. Here's some Vimscript to make navigation easier:

```vimscript
function! GoToFile()
	let l:name = matchlist(getline('.'), '["'']\([^''"]*\)')
	if !empty(name)
		let l:file = './resources/views/'.substitute(l:name[1], '\.', '/', 'g').'.blade.php'
		execute 'edit +0 '.l:file
	endif
endfunction
nmap <c-l> :call GoToFile()<CR>
```

This function takes the current line under the cursor, parses out a file name, and opens that file in the current buffer. Small functions like this are great for more efficiently navigating your projects. Vim also gives us access to a lot of information about the current file usable in plugins, `.vimrc`, `:echo`, and `:execute("")`. Here's a few common ones I end up reusing: 

```vimscript
let file = expand('%:t:r')       " /users/nick/src/file.c
let path = expand('%:t:h')       " /users/nick/src
let file_name = expand('%:t:r')  " file.c
let extension = expand('%:e')    " c
```

Vimscript may be a little terse, but the wins you can achieve in your workflow definitely make it rewarding.
